#### Description of the content of the ``Supplementary Figures`` file:
Supplementary figures S1-S12 contain GSMR effect plots between Alzheimer's disease and each of the relevant traits, respectively, when the APOE region have been removed.

Supplementary figures S13-S26 contain GSMR effect plots between Alzheimer's disease and each of the relevant traits, respectively, when chromosome 19 have been removed.

#### Description of the content of the ``Supplementary Tables`` file:
Supplementary table S1 contain additional findings from the cross-trait LDSC analysis, representing the sample overlap between Alzheimer's disease summary statistics and each of the other summary statistics, respectively. 

Supplementary table S2 and S3 contain results of the causal relationship between Alzheimerâ€™s disease and relevant traits, respectively, using bidirectional GSMR, and where chromosome 19 have been removed prior to running GSMR.
